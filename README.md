Here’s a README text for your Python script that explains its purpose, functionality, and how to use it:

# BLUM Interaction Script

This script interacts with the BLUM game platform API to automate various tasks such as claiming tasks, playing games, checking user balance, and claiming points from friends. It utilizes the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests and the `argparse` library to manage command-line arguments.

## Features

- Fetch and claim available tasks and subtasks.
- Generate game IDs and play games with randomly generated points (between 190 and 280).
- Check the current user balance.
- Claim points from friends.
- Start farming and claim farming points.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via pip if not already installed)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install requests

Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following syntax:

python blum_interaction.py <token> [options]

Parameters

	•	<token>: Your BLUM authorization token (required).
	•	--play-games <num>: Specify the number of games to play.
	•	--check-balance: Check and display the current user balance.
	•	--claim-tasks: Claim available tasks.
	•	--claim-friends: Claim points from friends.
	•	--start-farming: Start farming tasks and claim farming points.

Example

python blum_interaction.py YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN --play-games 5 --check-balance

This command will play 5 games and check the user balance.

Logging

The script generates a log of game activities, including game IDs, points generated, and balance updates. The log can be found in game_log.txt in the same directory as the script.

Notes

	•	Ensure your authorization token is valid and not expired.
	•	The script can be modified to suit your specific needs or additional functionalities.
